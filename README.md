# EduSteem

EduSteem is a educational organization tool for traditional and non traditional schools based on the process of "reflective learning" and what we have deemed "micro-scholarships". 

Please note this is a new project and most if not all the features should be considered testing quality. We hope to have the first version done by the begining of August 2018. If you would like to contribute feel free to download and play with the application, we will have tasks that need to be done as soon as the first month of development is complete.

### How it works

Each institution is comprised of at least one educator account, and one student account. 
The student accounts in turn must be connected to a valid parent account to receive micro-scholarships. At this time we are using the STEEM block chain as a basis for these payments. 

As the student works through their lessons a tally is generated based on their output. At the end of each week a post is generated based on the student's output. This output combines both unique student created content as well as a weekly assessment based on other activities the system records. This post is sent to the STEEM network as "proof of work" for the child that week. The payout that is returned to the student will be largely based on the quality of the student content as well as their marks in the other areas of the report. Of course the actual "amount" will depend on what the network can afford for each student based on current market value and of course how much the edusteem master account has to reward its users.

**Pay out structure:**

* Education: 60% (this goes to the parent account of the student)
* Reward: 25% (this goes to the student [However given the laws in most countries this will probably also have to go to the parent account])
* Software: 15% (this amount goes to the system for funding and development)
